Intended solution
-----------------
A straight forward three-way test of whether d1 - d2 is greater than or at most
180, then compute the appropriate rotation.

Another option is the brute force solution testing, for each of the 360
directions d (in increasing absolute distance from 0) whether d1 + d == d (mod
360).
