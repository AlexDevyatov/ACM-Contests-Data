  {\Large Advice, hints, and general information}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Your submissions will be run multiple times, on several different
    input files.  If your submission is incorrect, the error message you
    get will be the error exhibited on the first input file on which you
    failed.  E.g., if your instance is prone to crash but also incorrect,
    your submission may be judged as either ``wrong answer'' or ``run
    time error'', depending on which is discovered first.
    
  \item
    For problems with floating point output, we only require
    that your output is correct up to some error tolerance.

    For example, if the problem requires the output to be within
    either absolute or relative error of $10^{-4}$, this means that
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If the correct answer is $0.05$, any answer between $0.0499$ and $.0501$ will be accepted.
    \item If the correct answer is $500$, any answer between $499.95$ and $500.05$ will be accepted.
    \end{itemize}
    Any reasonable format for floating point numbers is
    acceptable.  For instance, ``17.000000'', ``0.17e2'', and
    ``17'' are all acceptable ways of formatting the number $17$.  For
    the definition of reasonable, please use your common sense.
\end{itemize}
