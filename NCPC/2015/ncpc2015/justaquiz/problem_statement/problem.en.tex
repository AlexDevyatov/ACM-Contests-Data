In the TV quiz \emph{Monstermind}, a contestant chooses a topic and is
then asked questions about it during a fixed period of time. The
contestant earns one point for each correct answer. When the time runs
out, the contestant must be silent.

Teresa has figured out such a niche topic that she knows all possible
questions that may be asked about it, as well as all the
answers. Since the competition is fierce, she has decided to sometimes
answer a question before the host finishes reading it. The host picks
each question uniformly at random from the pool of possible questions,
and each question may be asked multiple times. When reading a question,
the host reads at a pace of one word per second.

Teresa can interrupt the host mid-question---between words, or even before 
hearing the first word---but not
mid-word---that would be extremely impolite. Answering also takes one
second, and the host will start reading another question immediately
after an answer---unless Teresa interrupts again.

She wrote a program to help her choose the best moment to
answer, and now there is only one question left for you. How many
points does she expect to score?

For example, in the first sample test case the answer is completely
determined after hearing one word, so it is optimal to answer after
hearing it, and Teresa answers 2 questions correctly in 4 seconds. In the second
sample test case, if the first word is \texttt{What}, then it takes
too much time to wait for the question to finish. Therefore Teresa
says \texttt{Now!} 4 times and expects to get $1/3$ of the answers
right.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains two integers $t$ and $n$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$,
$1 \leq n \leq 100\ 000$), the duration of the quiz and the
number of questions. Each of the following $n$ lines contains a
question, which is a space-separated list of words terminated by a
question mark; and an answer, which is a single word.

Each word is a sequence of non-space ASCII printable characters, between the ASCII values of
`\texttt{!}' and `$\sim$'. Only the last word of a question has a
question mark (`\texttt{?}'). You can assume that no question is a prefix of another and
that punctuation marks are part of a word. Words spelled with different upper/lower case are assumed
to be different.

It is guaranteed that the total number of word characters is at most $100\ 000$.

\section*{Output}
Output the expected score of an optimal strategy.
Answers within a relative or absolute error of $10^{-6}$ will be accepted.
